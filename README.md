# TakeoutApp
For Programming project, I choose to implement the screen.

The screen and video demo indicate that it is a mobile app, so implement it with React Native.

I use Expo to help build the app, which help me to create a new app easily and help running the app both on simulators and on a physical device.

No third-party libraries are used. vector-icons are included in Expo

All images came from the figma file.
